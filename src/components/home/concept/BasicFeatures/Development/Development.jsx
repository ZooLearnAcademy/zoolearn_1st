      <h2>Evolutionary Note (Explained Simply)</h2>

      <p>
        Although humans look very different from starfish, we share a common
        developmental pattern with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both humans and echinoderms are <strong>deuterostomes</strong>, meaning
        that during early embryonic development, the blastopore forms the
        anus first and the mouth develops later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this similar pattern of development, humans are
        evolutionarily closer to echinoderms than to insects or molluscs,
        which are <strong>protostomes</strong>.
