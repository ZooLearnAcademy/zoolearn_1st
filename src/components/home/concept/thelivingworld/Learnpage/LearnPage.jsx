        <p>
          The Earth is filled with an unbelievable variety of living organisms —
          from tiny bacteria to giant blue whales. Life exists everywhere: icy
          mountains, hot deserts, deep oceans, lakes, forests, and even boiling
          hot springs.

        <p className="lp-guiding-question">
          But what makes something alive?
        </p>

        <p>
          Life is made of a complex, organized system of molecules that constantly
          perform chemical reactions to maintain essential activities such as
          growth, movement, metabolism, and reproduction.
        </p>

        
        <p>
          A key feature inside all living cells is <strong>protoplasm</strong> —
          the jelly-like living material. Biologist T.H. Huxley (1863) described it
          as the “physical basis of life.”

        <div className="lp-key-concept">
          Life is basically “organized chemistry” happening inside protoplasm.
