          Meerkats are primarily insectivores, but they are highly opportunistic feeders. Because they have very little body fat and a high metabolic rate, they must spend a large part of every day foraging for food, turning over stones, and digging into crevices.

        <strong>💧 The Water Mystery: How They Stay Hydrated</strong>
        <p>
          Meerkats do not need to drink standing water! In the Kalahari Desert, open water sources are virtually nonexistent for months. Meerkats solve this by absorbing 100% of their hydration from the moisture content of their prey, grubs, and the water-rich succulent tubers they dig up.
